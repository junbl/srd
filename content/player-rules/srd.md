# Player Rules

## Playing With Moxie

The _Moxie_ ruleset is designed for **cinematic gameplay**. The heart of that is **_narrative collaboration_**. It's all about creating a _shared imagination space, managing the spotlight, and diving into narration_. The rules will get you halfway there — they're all pointing towards keeping the pace flowing quickly and the action dramatic. The other half is in your hands, the players at the table, and the attitude you all approach the game with.

### Play Cinematically

**_Trust in the collaborative process._** Everyone at the table adds details into the story. You have to work together and play off of each other or the game, and the story you're telling, will fall flat.

**_Use the camera, your shared imagination._** Each player has two perspectives, from your character and as the audience watching this TV show. Use the camera and vivid description to paint a cool scene in everyone's mind.

**_Tell us what it looks like, before and after your rolls._** Give details about what you do, don’t just leave it at broad statements. Zoom in and out. Use the camera to show things outside of your own character as well — pan around, cut to other scenes, and describe NPCs. Invoke cinematic vibes and create great scenes.

### Play In Good Faith

**_Don’t be a weasel._** Do what your character would do, then let the GM map it back to the rules. Don’t overdo it trying to work your way into better rolls. The fun is letting the story flow naturally. When you ask the rules what happens next, follow where it points with enthusiasm.

**_Separate player and character knowledge._** It’s more fun when everyone knows what’s going on in the game. Don’t keep secrets from each other, keep them from characters. As a player, be aware of what your character knows and doesn’t know and play towards both.

**_Use the meta-channel sparingly._** This is conversation about the game between players. It’s unavoidable, but minimize it to keep that shared imagination in sync at the table. For anything longer than a quick question, call for a pause to talk things through, a clean break point to resume from later.

**_Know the rules._** When playing a game Made With Moxie, you can always take a look at this SRD for a refresher. The rules say a lot about the types of stories to be told with the game, and the less time you spend talking about the rules, the more time you have for roleplaying. Making a cheat sheet on rules you often forget can be a big help, or even just skimming the books you're using pre-game.

### Play To Tell A Story

Think of the game as a series of improv prompts, posed by yourselves and the rules. When you respond to them, consider the following:

- _What would my character do?_
- _What would make for a cool scene?_
- _What would move the story forward?_
- _What opens the door to get others involved?_

**_Don’t talk yourself out of fun._** The first idea that jumps into your head is often the one you should go with. Don’t overthink or rationalize yourself out of it. Like any great TV show character, go where the fun lies. Great stories involve excitement, danger, and hard choices.

**_Open doors and step through them._** The best scenes involve characters playing off of each other, so make chances for others to get involved. When someone invites you into a scene, step through that door — even if it means a bit of mental gymnastics to justify your character’s actions. And as long as you step through the door at times, remember that it can be just as interesting to close the door instead.

**_Work the spotlight._** There’s no turn order of any kind, but there is screen time. Strive to make sure everyone gets their fair share, including yourself.

- **Grab the spotlight** when there's a lull or you have a great idea.
- **Share the spotlight** by opening doors or following up on another PC's actions.
- **Pass the spotlight** when you've been holding it too long.
- **Point the spotlight** to see another PC's response or what they've been up to.
- **Never steal the spotlight.** Everyone works hard to set up their moment.

**_Don't play to win, play to tell stories._** Work towards the same goal — to tell a great story where everyone's PC has a chance to grow. Failure isn't losing, it's just another opportunity to have a great scene. Of course, your character wants to succeed! However, your goal as a player is keeping the story interesting. Play into the bad luck just as you do the good to help ensure you craft compelling stories.

### Play Characters That Grow

**_Leave lots of blank space._** Your PC starts with apast and connections to the world, but it's best as latticework. Learn who they are through play. Leave space for the other PCs and story to fit in.

**_Don’t be afraid to change._** PCs often go through hell. Any dramatic story has adversity. Let what happens change who they are. Announce what your PC's thinking, especially big shifts. If nobody else at the table knows, it’s not really happening in that shared imagination.

**_Don’t be afraid to stay the same._** Some aspects of your character might be immutable. That’s also part of what makes a great character. There can be those things they will stick to, even to the bitter end. Just make sure it’s worth it, and fun. Don’t die on small hills — die on entertaining ones.

**_Make time for smaller moments._** Quiet time, a conversation about nothing, introspection, reflection — these make for great scenes to flesh out your characters and the world. Don't just rush from action scene to action scene.

**_Most importantly, do stuff!_** Find reasons to get into the spotlight, push story arcs forward, and make fun scenes. When there's no opportunity, add some details to the story to create one!

## Core Rules

### Core Mechanic

When things get _risky_ and _dramatic_, roll to see what happens. Grab a few d6 dice (_d_) equal to the stat the GM picks to test, roll them, and take the highest to determine the **outcome** - 6: **Perfect**, 4-5: **Messy**, 1-3: **Grim**.

- A **critical** happens when you roll two or more 6s. **_Ignore any cuts_** and choose a **critical bonus**: _greater effect_ - _secondary effect_ - _setup a follow up_.
- A **disaster** happens when a grim is cut by a **thorn**. Whatever the risk was before, _double it_ - the worst case scenario comes to pass.

### Thorns

One or two d8s (_t_) added to your roll by the GM to reflect a tougher than normal task. Each 7 or 8 on a thorn **cuts** a roll's outcome by one step - perfect becomes messy, messy becomes grim, grim becomes a disaster.

A normal roll is +0t/_tough_. The GM adds thorns with their _gut feeling_, given the situation. They can make it +1t/_very tough_ or +2t/_extremely tough_. If it's at +3t, the task can't be done - break it up into steps or try a new approach.

If needed, the GM can assess difficulty factors to determine how many thorns to add:

- **Intrinsic**: Scale, opposing skill, numbers...
- **External**: Environment, training, tools...
- **Intangible**: Strong feelings, bad information, a curse...

**Damage** to a PC also adds thorns to a roll, but they don't count towards making it _impossible_.

### Smooth Flow

If a grim threatens to grind the story to a halt, the GM can **keep things moving** - you get what you want, but in a way that makes things much worse. If a roll somehow turns out to have no effect, you learn new info or setup for a follow up.

## Working Together

### Assist

You help another PC on a roll. State **how & why**, then **_roll 1d and share the risk_**. Include your roll result with theirs for the final outcome - then each narrate your contribution, using your result and bonds as a guide.

**_You can assist when another PC's actions prompts an impact move._** You make a 1d defense roll for them.

When you **share the risk**, you open yourself up to the consequences, which can prompt a more powerful or additional impact move, or the GM can take suspense instead.

### Teamwork

When 3+ PCs work togetherm the GM picks who rolls the action - sometimes the most skilled, sometimes the least. The other PCs assist.

### Setup

When a previous action makes a follow-up more effect, you assist without risk. You roll 1d as a normal assist, but don't share the risk.

### Outside Assistance

When an assist or setup comes from the world, like an NPC or the environment, **_the GM Rolls 1d_** to represent it.

## Dice Rolls

### Action Roll

Roll to pull off something risky. State **how & why**, calrifying your intent. The GM picks the stat that matches your intentions.

- **Perfect**: You do it, and avoid trouble.
- **Messy**: You do it, but there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.
- **Grim**: You fail, and there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.

The GM makes an impact move to introduce consequences. You don't get a defense roll against impact moves prompted by your own action rolls - avoiding danger is already factored into the roll.

### Defense Roll

Roll to avoid incoming trouble, **_but only when not caused by your own action_**. The GM calls for the roll and picks a stat to test.

- **Perfect**: You avoid the trouble.
- **Messy**: You avoid the brunt of the trouble. _The GM lightens the consequences_.
- **Grim**: You fail to avoid trouble. _The GM follows through on the move_.

The GM calls for defense rolls when they target you directly with an impact move. On a messy, there's still some trouble, like taking lesser damage, losing the chance to act or being in a worse position.

**_Defense is cinematic - a reaction, out of your hands_**. The GM picks the stat to fit the danger, your PC's likely reaction, vulnerabilities, and what feels right for the moment. This keeps it varied - you can't always use a strong stat.

### Montage Roll

Roll to condense a seequence you don't want to play out in detail, but still want to leave it up to the dice. **_Roll 2d_**, resolving it all as a single action roll, then narrate a few beats. Keep things moving or zoom in on a grim.

If multiple PCs join, **_each rolls 2d and shares the risk_**. Collaborate on the results. 6s on separate rolls don't count towards criticals.

## Diminishing Pools

### Pools

A set of d6s used to track things like time, resources or effort. When triggered, roll the pool and **drop** 1d for each 1-3 result. At 0d, the pool depletes and the fiction changes.

The size of a pool is **4d**/_short_, **6d**/_mid_, or **8d**/_long_. At **0d**, an event occurs, a situation ends or a resource is depleted. Make sure to reflect the fiction - if a pool and the fiction don't match up, adjust or scrap the pool.

- If not dice are dropped from a task pool on a messy or perfect action roll, instead take a **secondary effect**. If the roll was only 1d, you can instead **push yourself** to drop the last die.

- **Drop** 1d from the pool before rolling it when a talent tells you to do so, you have potency or you take the _greater effect_ critical bonus. This stacks.

Pools can be flexibly applied in many situations, usually by the GM. Some typical pools are listed below.

**_Note_**: _Pools are always notated with the size of the pool in front of it, usually written in italics_.

#### Timer Pools

Events unfolding in the background. Roll during key moments, when time passes, or a after few PCs take action.

#### Danger Pools

Threats becoming more likely. Roll during impact moves, major events or to increase threat level.

#### Task Pools

Effort to overcome tasks. Roll when progress is made in the task, usually an action roll.

#### Resource Pools

Quantity of something precious. Roll when the resource sees significant usage.

## Narrative Weight

### Vantage

Your character's frame of reference, the sum of their backstory, talents, and the current fiction - everything on your sheet and what's affecting you in the story. When a question arises about what you can do, have, or know, check it against your vantage: does it feel like a **_given_**, a **_stretch_** or a **_reach_**?.

**Proper vantage** opens up possibilities and gives the freedom to declare story details. Lacking it makes things fore difficult, or even impossible.

### Tools Of The Trade

You're assumed to have the gear and skills that are a given for your vantage. This avoids detailed tracking and ensures PCs are competent where it makes sense.

### Details

Use the details on your sheet as creative inspiration - _and limitations!_ - for roleplaying. They are player _(not GM)_ tools. When unsure of your PC's actions or thoughts, play towards or even against a relevant detail. Update details as the story unfolds, announcing the change and giving a vignette to _give it weight_ and _clearly convey_ the change to the other players.

## Character Details

### Background

Your heritage, upbringing, and profession - the core of your vantage. You choose any two that most influences who you are now. Each gives you three wises, evocative key phrases that clearly expand your vantage.

### Traits

Choose 2 that strongly define you and 1 that definitely doesn't.

### Desires

Choose 2 that you strong desire and 1 that you don't at all.

### Features

Detail your 3 most distinctive, outward features that others quickly notice.

### Talents

Special advantages and abilities that set your PC apart. At character creation, you choose a **path**, which gives you its core talent and a list of talents that align thematicalyl with it. You gain new talents as you level, choosing from your path list or taking talents from other paths.

The path name is simply a label for organizing talents thematically. On its own, it doesn't expand vantage. However, talents to expand vantage.

### Stats

Your core capabilities rated from 1/_poor_ to 3/_great_, used for action and defense rolls.

**Brawn** is _power, menace, toughness_.
**Agility** is _precision, athletics, reflexes_.
**Wits** are _smarts, trickery, reading situations_.
**Presence** is _influence, willpower, reading people_.

- Brawn and Agility are paired **physical stats**.
- Wits and Presence are paired **mental stats**.

### Bonds

Your dynamic with each PC. Match an intensity and a nature below, or write your own. Interpret as makes sense.

| Intensity | Nature      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Deep      | Affection   |
| Complex   | Camaraderie |
| Growing   | Curiosity   |
| Lowkey    | Doubts      |
| Playful   | Respect     |
| Tense     | Rivalry     |

Bonds are your strongest view of the other PC, and not necessarily reciprocal. You can change a bond anytime, such as in response to something they've done or something new you've learned about them. When it changes, give a short vignette. **_The other PC takes spark_**.

## Creative Freedom

### Set Dressing

Add minor, common sense details freely. Make assumptions and add _set dressing_ to scenes to play off of to keep things flowing dynamically. There's no need to check in with the GM - they'll step in if a detail goes beyond set dressing. Anything that's a _given_ for your vantage, like knowing someone or having equipment that makes sense, is set dressing.

### Tangles

Character-driven complications you introduce into a scene and have to follow-up on. In return, you take spark. Tangles must stem from your vantage or story arcs nad always have an immediate impact, like an action roll, an option closing off, or forcing inaction at an important moment. These are things like:

- **_Unwise decisions_** your PC would likely make.
- **_Personal motivations_** over group goals.
- **_Complications_** from beliefs or backstory.

### Story

_Pure cinematic momentum_. Each session you have **2 story**. Spend it to add **_story details_** that go beyond set dressing, creating new opportunities or shifting the scene in your favor. Added details must fit your vantage, _at least as a stretch_, or tie to a story arc. Example details:

- **_Character_**: Gear, contacts, backstory...
- **_Scene_**: NPC actions, objects, atmospherics...
- **_Setting_**: History, geography, factions...

Added details can't override rolls or contradict the established story. If your detail affects another PC, get permission. The GM can make a story roll to see how true or beneficial it is, or add nuance. On a grim, it may backfire! The GM can also veto details to keep things coherent.

There are _gray zones_ between set dressing, story details, and details simply too impactful to add. Set boundaries with your group.

## Story Arcs

Evocative phrases that give your PC and group a thematic direction. Find out where they lead through play - they're a starting direction, not the destination.

Pick a **group arc** together, then a **character arc**. Pick from the examples or write your own. Keep it short.

| Ambitions             | Struggles             | Growth            |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| _Build a Reputation_  | _Come Unraveled_      | _Embrace Change_  |
| _Explore the World_   | _Doubt Convictions_   | _Escape My Past_  |
| _Finish the Missions_ | _Feed My Vices_       | _Find Belonging_  |
| _Make Things Right_   | _Flirt with Betrayal_ | _Just Enjoy Life_ |
| _Satisfy Desires_     | _Keep a Secret_       | _Prove Myself_    |
| _Uncover the Truth_   | _Survive the Storm_   | _Settle Debts_    |

**_Take a spark by resolving an arc_** with a meaningful moment, _however big or small it is_. This could mean achieving your goal, adjusting for the next step, or moving on from it entirely.

Group arc unite players around a theme, while character arcs help you express your own story. Most importantly, they give you authorial power - you can use story or tangles to add story details tied to your arcs to bring them into play!

Story arcs signal to the GM that you want **_drama, dilemmas_** and **_opportunities_** to rise around them. Aim to resolve arcs within 3-5 sessions to keep things fresh. For struggles, get group permission - limiting them to a few sessions and involving everyone makes it fun.

## Damage

### Marks

Lesser damage, a temporary hindrance to a stat. **_Take +1t on the next roll with that stat, then clear the mark._**

If a stat is already marked, mark its paired stat instead. If both are already marked, take the related **harm**. Note that a mark can be taken even if you have the related harm.

Marks are often combined with another mark or other consequences when inflicted directly. You also take a mark when you **push yourself**.

### Harm

A hard hit your mind or body, general damage that doesn't need to be tracked in detail. **_This is the default damage from an impact move_**.

- Physical damage leaves you **bloodied**
- Mental damage leaves you **rattled**

**_Bloodied and rattled each inflict +1t on all rolls_**. However, when you have harm, you ignore thorns from marks to the related stats and the marks don't clear. Getting bloodied or rattled a second time leaves you **dropped** - you're out of the scene. Make a story roll (_usually 2d_) to see if you're just out temporarily, take a condition, or wind up dead.

Although bloodied and rattled are the default, especially dangerous attacks with **high risk** can lead straight to dropped, while **low risk** situations might leave you with a mark by default.

A messy defense roll leaves you with lesser damage - dropped becomes bloodied, rattled becomes a mark.

### Conditions

Specific injuries or maladies that impact only relevant situations and are often lasting. They often come combined with harm or a mark, and can be:

- **_Urgent_**.
- **_Short-term_**.
- **_Long-term_**.
- **_Permanent_**.

**_Take +1t when a condition specifically hinders a roll_**. It can also make an attempt impossible.

Conditions clear when it makes sense, life after a scene, with rest, or when a pool tracking them depletes. They may also require treatment or another specific method to clear them.

**_You have final say on long-term and permanent conditions_**. When you take one, work with the GM to find a good fit for your PC and the situation.

### Vex

An intense flash of emotion like _anger, fear, or confusion_. Vex is inflicted as a consequence, sometimes in addition to a mark or harm. **_You can also spend spark to take vex in place of rattled_**, if it fits the situation. Vex prompts an immediate, instinctive response. Choose one from **fight, flight, freeze** or **freakout**.

Interpret the response. Your PC is _driven by emotion_, but you decide how it plays out. Aim to balance what's fun and what fits the story. **_If there's a follow-up roll, take +1t on it_**. After the response, which always takes a beat or two, clear the vex.

## Recovery

### Healing

**_When you get bloodied or rattled, start a 4d pool_** to track its healing. When you **heal** harm from rest, treatment, or another source, roll the pool. At 0d, clear the harm. **_Treatment_** requires _time, tools, training_ and carries risk, and each pool can benefit from treatment only a single time.

**_Marks can't benefit from treatment_**. They are light enough already that only time heals them. They can only be cleared with rest, talents or rolling.

### Rest

A stretch of time between significant action. Paced for drama, not realism. Clear all marks and heal (roll pools).

### Downtime

Extended breaks. Fully heal and reset per-session talents. The GM rolls faction pools. After, they pick and deplete one to move the story forward. You can roll a montage to achieve something non-pivotal.

## Odds & Ends

### Potency

The ability to pull off _jaw-dropping_ feats. When you have potency on a task, you ignore thorns from difficulty (_but not from other sources like damage_) and can attempt normally impossible (+3t) tasks. A **potent feat** can do things like:

- **_Group action_**: Something a team of people could accomplish with an action.
- **_Stretching Limits_**: Something just beyond normal human limitations.
- **_Mystical_**: Feats that don't fit in with the above, but have a similar narrative impact.

Potency is only concerned with difficulty. It makes a normally +3t/_impossible_ roll possible at +0t. On a +1t/_very tough_ or +2t/_extremely tough_ roll, you take _greater effect_ (critical). On a +0t roll, you automatically succeed.

There's a _gray zone_ between jaw-dropping and too much. Something +3t is ok, but +4t is too far.

### Power Pools

The power of some talents or items, rolled as part of using it or in place of a stat. The same roll determines the outcome and drops dice from the pool. **_You can roll fewer dice to risk losing less_**. Roll when the talent or item is used.

### Buffs

Beneficial effects that expand vantage, ease tasks, make rolls unnecessary, or provide outside assistance. If you give a buff to an ally that persists in your absence, you can assist relevant rolls without risk.

### Quarrels

Conflicts between PCs — arguments, competitions, or even violence. Quickly resolve impasses in the story — don't waste time debating! **_First, make sure all players agree to the quarrel_**. Clearly state the stakes for winning and losing, erring on the side of dramatic. **_Each player rolls 2d and the highest wins_**. Others can assist, or they can join at 2d with their own agenda. On a tie, compromise or keep quarreling.

The winner narrates how they won. Then, the loser narrates how they handle losing. The results of the quarrel are **final** — it's okay for the PC that lost to be bitter, but the story moves in the winner's direction. **_Both sides take spark._**

### Push Yourself

Expend extra effort to activate certain talents that require it. After using the talent, **_mark a related stat_** (_your choice_). Talents that require you to push yourself can be activated without a mark once per session.

### Interrupt

Make an action roll to try to stop an impact move. This requires a specific talent. If not already involved, you now share the risk. On a messy, the GM takes or keeps suspense.

### Always

If you have the ability to **_always_** succeed or receive a benefit, it holds true **_unless_** the GM makes a **Counter** move, a strong NPC trait is in play, or other extenuating circumstances arise. _In short, "always" means 95% of the time._

### Level

A PC starts at level 1 and can go up to level 7. This takes 6 months of weekly play. For longer play, slow down progression (_below_).

## Beginning & Ending Sessions

### Pre-Session Recap

Before each session (afterthe first), recall the previous session and share your PC's best moment. **_Each player takes spark._** When all are finished, the GM **recaps** (_taking suspense_) tying all of these moments together into a proper _"Previously on..."_ and starts the session.

**_Note_**_: Spark carries over and story resets each session._

### Post-Session XP

After each session, **_take 1 XP_** and fill in its box. You start at level 1 and advance when you fill boxes equal to the next level _(Lvl. 4 to Lvl. 5 means 5 more boxes)_. This lets you choose a **_new talent_**.

**_The GM can award 1 bonus XP for a standout session_** _(about 1 in 4)_. For a slower pace, slash each XP box before filling it.
