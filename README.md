## Contributing

Read `notes.md` for contribution guidelines.

If you know git, clone the repository and create pull requests as usual.

If you don't, pick out a section you like from the list of available ones in `notes.md`. Write it up and send it over to **Wander#8114** in the Discord and I'll get it up on the repository with proper attribution. Alternatively, learn git! It's easy and useful.
